Hi! I Am Alee Akram. A Student-Developer based in Pakistan!
<hr>
I am a 18 year-old 12th grader. Currently Studying in Pacific College, I discovered and fell in love with React.js around the early 2019s. My future interests are in Software Engineering and Aritficial Intelligence. I ❤️ open source and create open source projects a lot too.

Also, My <a href="https://prokeyshub.com/">website</a> is pretty cool haha! Check that out too!
